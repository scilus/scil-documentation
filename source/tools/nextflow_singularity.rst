Singularity / Nextflow
======================

Singularity / docker
####################

    We have prepared most of our tools in a way that users don’t need to install too many dependencies on their computer. It saves you time and energy! The way to do that is to « wrap » the tool into a singularity, which you can see as en environment already all up-to-date and ready to use.



Nextflow
########

    Also, most of our tools are offered as a « Nextflow ». That means that we have already created pipelines (a list of the numerous steps to process your data, for example) that will run easily on your computer in a computationally efficient, robust and reproducible way. The goal is that two users, running the same job on two different computers at two different moments, should obtain the same results!
