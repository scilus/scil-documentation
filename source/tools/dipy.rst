DIPY
====

Dipy is a diffusion MRI data analysis. It is similar to MRtrix (see the "Other tools" section). One of Dipy's main authors and contributors, Eleftherios Garyfallidis, was a post-doc in our lab in 2014-2015. It offers many functions coded in python/cython that you can import as a library when analysing your data. It doesn't offer complete end-to-end scripts, but you can check their `official website <https://dipy.org/>`_'s tutorials for scripts examples.

Installing Dipy
    You can find instructions on their `github page <https://github.com/nipy/dipy>`_. But note that if you install Scilpy, it will install Dipy at the same time.

    .. warning::

        Before installing anything, please read the :ref:`ref_environments_page` page!
