Our lab's organization standards
================================

Here are some rules and good habits to follow in our lab.

- Please keep all folders names in lowercase (this is true when coding, but also generally everywhere, like in BrainData for instance), and prefer the use of underscores. Ex: my_project instead of MyProject.

- If you want to start a project with an existing dataset: You should find the raw data you are looking for in BrainData/databases. It is also possible that other lab member have alread processed this data exactly the same way as you want. Please check in BrainData/processedData. If you can't find your data, find the slack channel #help_me_find_data.

- If you want to save a finished project with...

    - an existing database in our lab: You can go in BrainData/processedData and create a folder **with a significative name**. Please add information on how your data was processed. Ask Arnaud if you have questions or if you think your data should rather be kept on Beluga.

    - a new database: Please talk with Arnaud if you have aquired data from a new database. Depending on the source/format/characteristic of the data, we will probably add the raw data to BrainData/databases.
