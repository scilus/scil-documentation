Machine Learning
================

Many students in our lab use machine learning. Most of us work closely with the VITAL lab. Similar to scilpy, their repository, vitalabAI, has a public version on Github and a private version on Bitbucket. If you are interested in machine learning, you can ask Pierre-Marc Jodoin for access.

The vitalabAI is a set of tools for machine learning, but not particularly created to use with diffusion data. Emmanuelle Renauld is working on creating a set of tools for students working both with machine learning and tractography, you can ask her about it.
