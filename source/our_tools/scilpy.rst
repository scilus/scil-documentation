What is it?
-----------

Scilpy is closely related to :ref:`ref_dipy`: it follows the same organization. But it also contains work that has been developped by our lab and that is not included yet into Dipy. We have a `public version <https://github.com/scilus/scilpy>`_ of Scilpy on Github, with work that has been tested and that we want to share with the community, and a private version on Bitbucket (you have to ask for access) with our work that is either not tested, still being developped or not converted into python 3.

For each script, you can use the -h option for explanations on how to use it. Ex:

    .. code-block:: bash

        scil_compute_fodf.py -h

If you don't know the name of a script, you may look for all scripts matching some keywords with:

    .. code-block:: bash

        scil_find_script.py keyword

Finally, for a html version of the help, you will find the description of all scripts and modules, as well as some tutorials, on `scilpy's official documentation <https://scilpy.readthedocs.io/>`_.


Installing scilpy
-----------------

Scilpy currently supports python versions 3.6 to 3.8. There are many ways to install a python version on your system. We refer the reader to section :ref:`ref_python_dist` for one such method. Once your python distribution is correctly installed, Scilpy can be installed by following the procedure outlined below.

    - Users: you can follow the instructions on the Github page or follow these instructions :

    .. code-block:: bash

        git clone https://github.com/scilus/scilpy.git 
        cd scilpy 
        pip install -e .

    - Developpers: instead, you should try :bash:`python setup.py develop`

    .. warning::

        Before installing anything, please read the :ref:`ref_environments_page` page!
