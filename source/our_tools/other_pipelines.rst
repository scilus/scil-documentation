After tractoflow
================

Once the preprocessing and the tracking are done, scilpy also contains scripts to separate your data into known bundles (Recobundles), vizualize your results (ex, scil_visualize_bundles_mosaic.py), create statistics on your bundles and so on.

We have a QA pipeline which creates a summary of the quality of your data, you can ask Guillaume if you are interested.

You can also ask Fran√ßois for his tractometry repo.

Finally, if you are interested in doing machine learning with diffusion data, you can check our `dwi_ml repository <https://github.com/scil-vital/dwi_ml>`.
