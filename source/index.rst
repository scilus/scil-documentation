Here, you will find a summary of the tools we develop, and some clues on how we do things
in the lab, from using Linux to developing code. Please don't hesitate to tell us if you find any mistake or misprint or if some information is missing. You can create an issue report here on our Github page (https://github.com/scilus/scil-documentation/issues) or talk with Emmanuelle.
